# Introduction

In assignment x I'm supposed to summarize a post by Tero karvinen. This post is called "Command Line Basics Revisited" and it can be read [here](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/?fromSearch=command%20line%20basics%20revisited). The post can be summarized with a couple of bullet points. The other assigment is divided into subassignments. These tasks are to be done inside a Linux environment. I used a virtual machine that has Debian in it.


## Command Line Basics Revisited summarized

- CLI (Command Line Interface) in Linux has been around for for a long time (Karvinen s.a).
- A "$" means that a normal user is using the cli (Karvinen s.a). Tero (s.a) also adds that the "#" transforms the rest of the line into a comment. I'll add here that if there is a "#" instead of a "$", it means that the cli is being operated by root. This can be seen when a user switches into a root user.
- Tero (s.a) explains that in Linux cli a user is always in a directory. Important commands when moving around include ```pwd``` ```ls``` ```cd``` ```less``` (Karvinen s.a).
- pwd (Print Working Directory) tells the user the current directory they are in. ls (list) lists the files and directories inside the current directory. cd (Change Directory) can be used to traverse between directories. less can be used to read the contents of a file without being able to make changes. Another command for reading file contents is cat (concatenate) which is good for files with contents that aren't too large. The less command is very useful when reading long outputs of another command. For example this ```ls | less``` command would put the output of the ls command into less (Karvinen s.a). 
- With text editors like nano or pico a user can make and modify files (Karvinen s.a). Important commands when working with files include ```mkdir``` ```mv``` ```cp``` ```rmdir``` ```rm``` (Karvinen s.a).
- mkdir creates a new directory. For example ```mkdir dire``` creates a directory named dire inside the working directory. The mv command can be used to move files or directories. It can also be used to rename files or directories. With the cp command a user can copy files or directories. ```cp -r``` copies the directory with everything inside it. The rmdir command can be used to remove an empty directory. Files can be removed with the rm command. The rm command can be also used to remove a directory with contents by using -r like this ```rm -r [target]```. (Karvinen s.a.)
- With ssh a user can remotely securely command a target device. Tero (s.a) explain that to open a remote connection like this a user needs to write a command like this ```ssh [username]@[server]```. To exit the session a user needs to type ```exit```. To copy a directory to the remote machine, one would need to use a command like this ```scp -r [directory] [username]@[server]:[destination]```. To be noted that the user has to be exited to remote session before running this command since it runs natively. (Karvinen s.a.)
- With the man which is short for manual a user can find useful information on commands. For example a command ```man ls```opens the manual page for the command ls. ```--help``` or ```-h``` can also be useful. They open a more compact version of useful information on commands. For example ```ls --help``` and ```wget -h```. (Karvinen s.a.)
-  To find the history of typed commands in a session, one would simply use the ```history``` command (Karvinen s.a).
-  Tero (s.a) recommends the use of the tab key on a keyboard. With the tab a user can fill needed information without manually writing it. This prevents unnecessary typos. When pressing the tab key twice it shows possible results. (Karvinen s.a.)
-   Tero (s.a) states that the important directories in a Linux system include ```/``` ```/home/``` ```/home/[username]/``` ```/etc/``` ```/media/``` ```/var/log/```. Root directory is / "everything is under /". /home/ home directories are here. A home directory for a certain user can be found at /home/[username]. "All system wide settings" can be found at /etc/. Removable media can be found at /media/. System logs can be found at /var/log/. (Karvinen s.a.)
-   It is important to practice the principle of least privilege. When higher privileges are required the user can run commands with sudo. (Karvinen s.a.)
-   Package managers are used to manage packages in Linux systems. ```sudo apt-get update``` updates the list of available packages. ```sudo apt-get install``` is used to install software. To remove a software and its settings a user can use the command ```sudo apt-get purge```. (Karvinen s.a.)
